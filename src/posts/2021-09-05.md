description: 4-3 W. There was no chance Blunder_Bus_ was ever going to win this match. After going down 2-0, he hung most of his hopes on a "momentum shift" because he only lost by one goal in the scond game (as opposed to 3 goals in the first game). He barely won the next two games in overtime, hardly a cause for celebration. To his credit, he did tie up the series and force overtime. But moo_quack_three, back against the wall 3-1 in the final game, stepped up to secure victory.
